        <h3>
            <p>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are two types of camels: 
                dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. 
                Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.

            <h3>
                <p>
                    Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle between the bill and forehead.
                     All pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head. 
                    Because of their long wings and powerful flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.

        <h3>
            <p>chameleon  refers to a kind of small lizard with large, bulging eyes and a long tail. 
                The most striking feature of a chameleon is its ability to change the colour of its skin to match its surroundings
                Most chameleons can be found in the wild in Africa, Madagascar and the Middle East.

            <h3>
                <p>Teddy bears have a depth of character that other toys don't have, and in playing with one a child brings it to life. 
                    The bear helps to stimulate and develop their imagination. 
                    “Teddy bears encourage this type of imaginative play by their very nature, in a way a gadget or electronic toy can't.”

            <h3>
                <p>Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, 
                    with black fur around their eyes and on their ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders.

            <h3>
                <p>Cicadas are 1 - 1 1/2 inches long. They are stout with a green or brown body and black markings on the body. 
                    They have four, clear, fly-like wings and the first pair is much longer than their abdomen. 
                    The wings which are folded over their back look like a tent
